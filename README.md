## Revolutionizing Soil Image Classification with Advanced CNN Models

#### Dataset

The Soil Types Dataset is a collection of images focused on different types of soil, consisting of six folders, each representing a distinct soil type. The dataset includes a total of 144 labeled photos, showcasing the diversity of soils in this collection. This dataset is designed to aid in soil classification and analysis tasks, providing valuable visual information for research, machine learning, and data analysis purposes. Each folder within the dataset represents a specific soil type, enabling researchers and practitioners to study and differentiate between various soil characteristics and properties.

#### Project Overview:

This project involves the development of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models for soil image classification. Techniques such as Batch Normalization, Dropout, and Early Stoppage were employed to enhance model performance. Rigorous hyperparameter tuning and evaluation were conducted to optimize CNN architectures, ultimately achieving classification accuracy of up to 60.87%. The project demonstrates expertise in machine learning model development and can be applied to enhance decision-making in agriculture, geology, engineering, and related fields.
